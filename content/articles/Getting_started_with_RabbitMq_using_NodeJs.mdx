## Introduction to RabbitMq

RabbitMq is a message broker that allows sending and receiving messages between different services. It is a message broker that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). Written with Erlang Programming Language.

## Installing RabbitMq

RabbitMq can be installed on different operating systems Using there respective package managers. RabbitMQ requires Erlang/OTP to be installed beforehand, please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html) for more information.

* Linux
    

```bash
sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
```

* Mac
    

```bash
brew install rabbitmq
```

Once installed, we can start the RabbitMq server using the following command:

```bash
sudo rabbitmq-server
```

Once the server is started, we can access rabbitmq from our application using the default port **5672**.

To enable the RabbitMq management console, we can run the following command:

```bash
sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
```

we can access the RabbitMq management console by visiting ["http://localhost:15672/"](http://localhost:15672/) in your browser. The default username and password are **guest**.

## Setting up RabbitMq with NodeJs

To interact with RabbitMq from NodeJs, we can use the **amqplib** library. We can install the library using the following command:

```bash
npm install amqplib
****`

To connect to RabbitMq from NodeJs and create channel to interact with RabbitMq, we can use the following code:

```javascript
const amqp = require("amqplib");

const connect = async (url) => {
  const connection = await amqp.connect(url);
  const channel = await connection.createChannel();

  return channel;
};

connect("amqp://localhost:5672").then((channel) => {
  console.log("Connected to RabbitMQ");
  channel.close();
  process.exit(0);
});
```

Now, we have a channel to interact with RabbitMq. We can use this channel to send and receive messages from RabbitMq. let name our queue **mq-test-queue** and send a message to the queue.

```javascript
connect("amqp://localhost:5672").then((channel) => {
  console.log("Connected to RabbitMQ");
  channel.assertQueue("mq-test-queue");
  console.log("Queue created");
  channel.sendToQueue("mq-test-queue", Buffer.from("Hello World!"));
  console.log("Message sent");
});
```

We have created a queue **mq-test-queue** and sent a message **Hello World!** to the queue. To create Queue, we have used the **assertQueue** method and to send a message to the queue, we have used the **sendToQueue** method.

To receive a message from the queue, we can use the **consume** method.

```javascript
connect("amqp://localhost:5672").then((channel) => {
  console.log("Connected to RabbitMQ");
  channel.assertQueue("mq-test-queue");
  console.log("Queue created");
  channel.sendToQueue("mq-test-queue", Buffer.from("Hello World!"));
  console.log("Message sent");
  channel.consume("mq-test-queue", (msg) => {
    console.log("Message received", msg.content.toString());
  });
});
```

**consume** method takes a callback function and passes message object to the callback function to access the message content using **msg.content.toString()**.

After consuming the message, we need to ack or nack the message to remove the message from the queue. We can use the **ack** method to acknowledge the message and **nack** method to reject the message.

For this example, we will ack the message after consuming the message.

```javascript
const amqp = require("amqplib");

const connect = async (url) => {
  const connection = await amqp.connect(url);
  const channel = await connection.createChannel();

  return channel;
};

connect("amqp://localhost:5672").then((channel) => {
  console.log("Connected to RabbitMQ");
  channel.assertQueue("mq-test-queue");
  console.log("Queue created");
  channel.sendToQueue("mq-test-queue", Buffer.from("Hello World!"));
  console.log("Message sent");
  channel.consume("mq-test-queue", (msg) => {
    console.log("Message received", msg.content.toString());
    channel.ack(msg);
  });
});
```

We can see messages sent and received successfully from the queue. using rabbitmq management console.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have learned how to set up RabbitMq and interact with RabbitMq from NodeJs using the **amqplib** library. We have created a queue, sent a message to the queue, and received a message from the queue.
